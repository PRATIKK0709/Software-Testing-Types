## Introduction

Software testing is a crucial part of the software development life cycle that ensures the application behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements. Testing helps identify defects early in the development process, reducing the risk of issues in production.

## Types of Testing

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It ensures that each unit of the software performs as designed.

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration testing verifies the interactions between different components or modules of the software. It aims to identify issues that may arise when integrating these components.

### 3. System Testing

System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole. It checks if the integrated components work together as intended and meet the overall system requirements.

### 4. Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing validates whether the software meets the user's acceptance criteria. It can be further divided into alpha testing and beta testing, where alpha testing is conducted by the internal team, and beta testing involves real users.

### 5. Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality. It helps maintain the stability of the software across different releases.

### 6. Performance Testing

Performance testing evaluates the system's responsiveness, scalability, and stability under different conditions. Types of performance testing include load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.

### 7. Security Testing

Security testing assesses the software's resistance to unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and potential security threats. It includes penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

### 8. Usability Testing

Usability testing focuses on the user-friendliness and overall user experience of the software. It ensures that the application is intuitive and easy to use.

### 9. Compatibility Testing

Compatibility testing checks the software's compatibility with different environments, browsers, and devices. It ensures a consistent user experience across various platforms.

### 10. Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is a dynamic and ad-hoc testing approach where testers explore the application to find defects without predefined test cases. It relies on tester's intuition, experience, and creativity.
